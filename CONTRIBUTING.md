# Contributing guidlines

## Commit naming

* every commit name should be started with `#{gem_name}`. We need to be sure, what gems we changed in this commit
* you can use something like this `#{gem_name1} #{gem_name2}`, if your commit is about changing of 2 gems
* don't forget to add space in the beginning of commit message. Otherwise your commit message will be just comment
